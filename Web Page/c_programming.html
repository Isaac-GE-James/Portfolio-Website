                Im facinated with computers, taking a great intrest on how they work on a low level, down to the individual transistors. 
                I've always wanted to work on a computer and create software where I can interacat with the low level parts of the computer, 
                diving into the individual registers and what not. I've always seen C as the lowes level high level programing language I could learn, 
                which is what lead me to picking it up. I havent yet beable to find a way to draw pixels directly to the screen without the use of an exteral graphics libary,
                however that is my end goal as of now, as it will allow me to write a software rendere from scratch.
                If you would like to see my current progess with C you can look <a href="https://github.com/Isaac-GE-James/C-programming" style="color: #fff7e9;">here</a> 
                as I will be updating the git repository will all of my C projects.

            After my first hello world, IS decided a good small project to help me get a grip of the basics in the laguage would be to write naugts and crosses. 
            The game simply runs in the terminal, where the user can imput the position they wont to play, while going up agains a very basic bot.
            <br><br>
            I have also worked on a few more thing in C, including the implimentation of different data types and stucts, which you cna find
