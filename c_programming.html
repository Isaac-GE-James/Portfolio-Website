                Im fascinated with computers, taking a great interest on how they work on a low level, down to the individual transistors. 
                I've always wanted to work on a computer and create software where I can interact with the low level parts of the computer, 
                diving into the individual registers and what not. I've always seen C as the 'lowest level' high level programming language that I could learn, 
                which is what lead me to picking it up. I haven't yet be able to find a way to draw pixels directly to the screen without the use of an external graphics library,
                however that is my end goal as of now, as it will allow me to write a software renderer from scratch.
                If you would like to see my current progress with C you can look <a href="https://github.com/Isaac-GE-James/C-programming" style="color: #fff7e9;">here</a> 
                as I will be updating the git repository will all of my C projects.

            After my first hello world, IS decided a good small project to help me get a grip of the basics in the language would be to write naughts and crosses. 
            The game simply runs in the terminal, where the user can input the position they wont to play, while going up against a very basic bot.
            <br><br>
            I have also worked on a few more thing in C, including the implementation of different data types and structures, which you cna find
