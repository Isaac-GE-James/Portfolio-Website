                I am a game developer located in south of London, looking to get into the games industry. 
                I've been making games and art throughout my life, completing game james as well as my own personal projects.
                Programming has been a hobby of mine since I first learnt about it, starting with python in 2017, then moving on to unity and c# in 2018. 
                In recent years I've moved form unity to the open source game engine Godot, form most of my projects, 
                however I still enjoy using unity form time to time. Another hobby of mine has been 3D modeling, where I began to use Blender in late 2019. 
                Since I was very young I would make stop motion animations with things like lego and clay, so moving to 3D modeling was a natural next step for me.
                I'm eager to work in the games industry to meet people with the same passion as me, as well as to learn more about the craft I've dedicated myself to.

                    C is a programming language that's intrigued me, as I've always found the concepts of low level computing fascinating.

                Games aren't the only thing I make. I also enjoy partaking in film making, 
                3D art (as mentioned above) and also music. Feel free to have a look at some of the other non-game related things ive done.

                    For a school project I was tasked with creating a 30 second short film, that used a variety of shot types and camera angles. 
                    I decided to try an create a 3D animation in the three days given.
