            <p>
                The C programing language is a language that has always intreaged me. Computers have been a facination of mine for several years, 
                with the idea of programming on a bare bones level, to squeese as much out of these machines as possable. 
                Up untill resently i have focused my programming efforts on learning the important consepts of progamming, 
                as well as progamming within the context of games (with languages such as C#, python and GDscript), 
                however now I am on my journy of learning a laguage that I have always wanted to. 
                These are a few of the notable things i have accopleshed so far.

            <p>
                Progamming is a skill that can be used to develop problem solving tools, it can also be use to simply entertain. 
                Have a look at a few fun and hopefuly handy things I've made.
